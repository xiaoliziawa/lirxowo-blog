## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LyraVoid/Mizuki.git
   cd Mizuki
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Enable the package manager version declared by the project
   corepack enable

   # Install project dependencies
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure your blog (optional):**
   - Set `ENABLE_CONTENT_SYNC=false` in a root `.env` file if you want to use only local content.
   - Edit `src/config/siteConfig.ts` and the other modules in `src/config/` to customize the site.
   - At minimum, replace `siteURL` with the public URL of your deployment.

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Your blog will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 📝 Content Management

- **Create a post:** `pnpm new-post -- <filename>`; both `.md` and `.mdx` are supported.
- **Edit posts:** Modify files in `src/content/posts/`.
- **Edit About or Friends page content:** Modify the corresponding files in `src/content/spec/`.
- **Edit structured page data:** Modify the relevant files in `src/data/`.
- **Add article-local images:** Keep them next to the post and reference them with a relative path such as `./cover.webp`.
- **Add public images:** Place them under `public/` and reference them with a root-relative path such as `/images/example.webp`.

> **Before publishing:** This repository includes demo posts, page data, albums, and images. Remove or replace the sample content before deploying your own site.

### 🚀 Deployment

Deploy your blog to any static hosting platform:

- **Vercel:** Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
- **Netlify:** Deploy directly from GitHub
- **GitHub Pages:** Use the included GitHub Actions workflow
- **Cloudflare Pages:** Connect your repository

- **Environment Variable Configuration (Optional):** Refer to `.env.example` for configuration

Before deployment, update `siteURL` in `src/config/siteConfig.ts`. Do not commit `.env` or credentials to Git. For hosted builds, configure environment variables in the hosting provider instead.

The optional `.env.example` settings include Bilibili session data and IndexNow credentials. Only configure them when needed, keep them in local or hosting-provider secrets, and never commit real values.

## 📝 Writing Content

Posts use `.md` or `.mdx` files under `src/content/posts/`. The only required frontmatter fields are `title` and `published`; optional fields cover summaries, images, tags, categories, drafts, pinning, comments, aliases, permalinks, attribution, and browser-side encryption.

Markdown and MDX support callouts, KaTeX math, Expressive Code, Mermaid, PlantUML, GitHub cards, Wiki Links, spoilers, responsive images, image grids, lightboxes, and HTML embeds. Encrypted posts are excluded from RSS and Atom, but browser-side encryption is not server-side access control.

See the complete [Content Authoring Guide](docs/CONTENT_AUTHORING.md) for the frontmatter schema, writing syntax, image rules, diagrams, video embeds, encryption limits, and publishing checklist.

## 🧩 Markdown Extensions

Mizuki uses one Markdown/MDX pipeline for article pages, RSS, and Atom. It supports callouts, math, enhanced code blocks, Mermaid, PlantUML, GitHub cards, Wiki Links, spoilers, responsive images, image grids, Fancybox lightboxes, and HTML embeds.

For syntax and examples, see the [Content Authoring Guide](docs/CONTENT_AUTHORING.md). PlantUML uses the public server configured in `src/config/markdownConfig.ts` by default, so diagrams must not contain secrets or private data.

## 🎯 Configuration Guide

### 🔧 Basic Configuration

Configuration is split into focused modules under `src/config/`; `src/config/index.ts` is the shared export entry point. The main site settings live in `src/config/siteConfig.ts`:

```typescript
export const siteConfig: SiteConfig = {
  title: "Your Blog Name",
  subtitle: "Your Blog Description",
  siteURL: "https://example.com/", // Keep the trailing slash
  lang: "en", // e.g. "zh_CN", "ja", or "zh_TW"
  timeZone: "Europe/London", // Any valid IANA time zone
  themeColor: {
    hue: 210, // 0–360
    fixed: false, // Hide the visitor theme-color picker when true
  },
  featurePages: {
    anime: true,
    diary: true,
    friends: true,
    projects: true,
    skills: true,
    timeline: true,
    albums: true,
    devices: true,
    aiTools: true,
  },
  // Keep the remaining fields from the template defaults.
};
```

Other commonly used configuration files include:

- `src/config/navBarConfig.ts` — navigation links and menus.
- `src/config/profileConfig.ts` — avatar, name, bio, and social links.
- `src/config/sidebarConfig.ts` — sidebar widgets, order, positions, and responsive behavior.
- `src/config/backgroundWallpaper.ts` and `src/config/effectsConfig.ts` — wallpaper and visual effects.
- `src/config/commentConfig.ts` — global Twikoo or Giscus settings. Comments are disabled by default; set `enable: true` and configure the selected provider before using them.
- `src/config/musicConfig.ts` — music player mode and playlist source.
- `src/config/markdownConfig.ts` — Wiki Links, automatic image grids, and PlantUML.
- `src/config/permalinkConfig.ts` — optional global permalink format.
- `src/config/expressiveCodeConfig.ts` — code block themes and behavior.

### 📱 Feature Page Content

The page switches are controlled by `siteConfig.featurePages`. Page content and data are kept separate from page templates:

| Page | Content or data source |
| :--- | :--- |
| About | `src/content/spec/about.md` |
| Friends | `src/content/spec/friends.md` and `src/data/friends.ts` |
| Anime | `src/config/siteConfig.ts` for the source mode; `src/data/anime.ts` for local data |
| Diary | `src/data/diary.ts`, or a Memos endpoint configured by `diaryApiUrl` |
| Albums | `public/images/albums/`; each local album uses an `info.json` file |
| Projects | `src/data/projects.ts` |
| Skills | `src/data/skills.ts` |
| Devices | `src/data/devices.ts` |
| Timeline | `src/data/timeline.ts` |
| AI Tools | `src/data/ai-tools.ts` |

Avoid editing `src/pages/*.astro` just to change page content; those files define the layout and rendering behavior.

### 📦 Code-Content Separation (Optional)

Mizuki can separate theme code from blog content into two repositories. This is useful for private content, independent content versioning, or collaboration, but it is optional.

**Quick Selection**:

| Use case | Configuration | Content location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local content** | `ENABLE_CONTENT_SYNC=false` | `src/content/`, `src/data/`, and `public/images/` |
| **External content repository** | `ENABLE_CONTENT_SYNC=true` and `CONTENT_REPO_URL=...` | A separate repository synchronized into the paths above |

**One-Click Enable/Disable**:

```bash
# Local content mode (recommended for getting started)
# Put this in .env to disable synchronization explicitly.
ENABLE_CONTENT_SYNC=false
pnpm dev

# External content repository mode
# 1. Copy the example configuration
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env
ENABLE_CONTENT_SYNC=true
CONTENT_REPO_URL=https://github.com/your-username/Mizuki-Content.git
# CONTENT_DIR=./content  # Optional; this is the default

# 3. Synchronize content and start the site
pnpm run sync-content
pnpm dev
```

An external repository uses this structure:

```text
Mizuki-Content/
├── posts/       # .md and .mdx posts
├── spec/        # About, Friends, and other Markdown page content
├── data/        # Structured page data such as projects or skills
└── images/      # Public images, including albums and post assets
```

The sync script maps these directories to `src/content/posts/`, `src/content/spec/`, `src/data/`, and `public/images/`. `src/data/ai-tools.ts` is owned by the code repository and is preserved during synchronization.

> **Sync warning:** When `ENABLE_CONTENT_SYNC` is enabled, `pnpm dev` and `pnpm build` run the sync hook automatically. If `CONTENT_DIR` already contains a Git repository, the script fetches and resets it to its `main` or `master` remote branch. It can also back up existing runtime directories as `.backup`, create junctions or copies, and commit synchronized changes in the code repository. Commit or back up local content changes before running it, and do not edit synchronized target files directly.

For private repositories, use an SSH URL or configure credentials through the deployment platform. Never commit tokens in `.env` or put them in a public repository URL.
